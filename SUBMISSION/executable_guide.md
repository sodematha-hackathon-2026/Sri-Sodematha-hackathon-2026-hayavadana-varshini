# Functional App & Executable Guide - Team Hayavadana

## 1. Development Access
Our application is built using the **Expo (React Native)** framework, allowing for cross-platform execution on both Android and iOS.

### 1.1 Direct Preview (Expo Go)
The fastest way to experience the live-backend integrated app:
1.  Install **Expo Go** from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
2.  Scan the QR code generated by our development server (accessible via `npm run start` in `seva_mobile`).
3.  Ensure the mobile is on the same network as the backend for local API sync.

## 2. Generating Standalone Executable (APK/AAB)
To generate a permanent binary for Android:
```bash
cd seva_mobile
npm install -g eas-cli
eas build -p android --profile preview
```
*Note: This generates a link to download a universal `.apk` file.*

## 3. Backend Deployment
The functional backend is container-ready. 
- **Executable JAR**: Located at `seva_platform/target/seva-platform.jar` (after running `./mvnw package`).
- **Live Sync**: The backend is pre-configured with **Firebase Admin SDK** for real-time interaction.

## 4. Submission Artifacts Checklist
- [x] **Source Code**: Fully modular directory structure.
- [x] **UI/UX Prototype**: Documented flow in `UI_UX_SPEC.md`.
- [x] **Backend Integration**: Full API and DB documentation in `BACKEND_TECH_SPEC.md`.
- [x] **Verification**: Evidence of successful features in `IMPLEMENTATION_VERIFICATION.md`.
