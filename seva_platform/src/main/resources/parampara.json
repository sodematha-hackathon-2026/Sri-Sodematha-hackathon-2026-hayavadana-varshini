            "Vishnutirtha was younger brother and direct disciple of Madhva. He was foremost among all. Madhva happened to be an embodiment of rich knowledge where as his brother Vishnutirtha was well known as a unique treasure of Vairagya (detached attachment). It was nothing but the Vairagya got incarnated into tangible form of Vishnutirtha. Vishnutirtha served his parents devotedly in person. After the demise of parents, he approached Madhva residing in Vishnumangala for Chaturmasya and begged him for Samnyasashrama. Since it was the period of Chaturmasya, Vishnutirtha was not given Samnyasashrama there. He was asked to go back to Pajaka. Renouncing food and relaxation, Vishnutirtha awaited Madhva's arrival like Bharat for Rama.",
            "Vishnutirtha was an eminent orator and was endowed with rich spiritual power of rare kind. He was the most dedicated practitioner of spiritual discipline. Vishnutirtha went to Harishchandra mountain and engaged in deep and rigorous austerity. He was grown up with unique mystic powers. The vow of fast observed by him was extra ordinary and it was beyond the reach of others. He gave up regular food and used to sip the Panchagavya once in five days. He then also renounced that sipping and resorted to take only a few dried leaves or small quantity of water. With fully controlled breathing, Vishnutirtha used to meditate on Indwelling Lord and accomplished the realisation of that form. Even the gods wondered at the peak achievement of Vishnutirtha with regard to his fruitful fulfilment.",
            "It is widely known that Vishnutirtha has authored some works like Samnyasapaddhati, Shravanadwadashinirnaya, Vishnupanchakanirnaya, Panchasamskarasangraha and others. He had two pupils namely Vyasatirtha and Aniruddhatirtha. The hierarchy, continued by Vyasatirtha, is presently well known as Sri Sode Vadiraja Matha and the hierarchy advanced by Aniruddhatirtha is famous as Subrahmanya Matha. Madhva blessed the icons of Bhuvaraha and Abhedyasamputa to Vishnutirtha. Later on, Vishnutirtha presented the Bhuvaraha icon to Vyasatirtha and Abhedyasamputa to Aniruddhatirtha. The Bhuvaraha icon is an unique styled one where Bhuvaraha rests on the hood of a serpent with Bhudevi sitting on the left thigh of the Lord. The Lord appears to be pleased and eager to grant merciful bliss to his consort. By virtue of unique Mahima of Vishnutirtha, the lineage was, then named after him. Later on, it was also known as Kumbhasi Matha.",
            "Vishnutirtha specially got involved in the adoration of Hayagriva formed Lord. He worshipped an icon of Hayagriva with due reverence and later on, he gave it to Sri Vadirajatirtha when the latter visited the cave of penance in Harishchandra mountain. Since then, that icon is being worshipped daily in the lineage of Sri Sode Vadiraja Matha by all pontiffs. Vishnutirtha had not left his mortal body. The tradition and ancient documentation confirm the fact that he is still alive and is doing rigorous penance in the Kumara mountain of Western Ghats near Kukke Subrahmanya. After the completion of one thousand years by divine calculation, Vishnutirtha, at the instruction of Madhva, will come down and uncover the copy of 'Sarvamula' works kept underground at Kadtil. He is blessed with rare and rich opportunity of rightly re-establishing and propagating the Dvaita Siddanta.",
            "The tradition records (Sri Sode Vadiraja Matha) that the full moon day (Poornima) of Pushya month is the day on which Vishnutirtha resorted to the Kumara mountain alive. With the grace of Lord Vedavyasa, enjoying close and explicit resemblance of Madhva, getting involved in rigorous penance without the adverse effect of old age and demise, obtaining lovely and blessing kindness of Madhva in abundance and becoming an officiating authority in propagating the Siddhanta etc, Vishnutirtha is known as one of Rujugods by tradition."

            "Sri Vishwavandyatirtha ord-ained a qualified student as his successor and named him Sri Ratnagarbhatirtha. Ratnagarbhatirtha studied Veda, Vedanga and Vedanta under his Guru and became a matchless scholar within a short period of time. He was an inestimable Yogin who received Lord's choicest blessings by worshipping and adoring Him through the means of supreme meditation. Living in naturally attractive, pleasing and secluded place Narala, near Ganjimatha in Mangalore Taluk, he did severe penance. With extra-ordinary power of Yogic discipline, Ratnagarbhatirtha used to go up in the space for more than hundred feet and perform the Tapas. It was his daily routine and easily accessible work. By the impact of his rigorous Tapas, the cruel beasts of that region gave up their born enmity mutually. When the king of Chowt family of that region was attacked by his enemies and outcast of his kingdom, he, while fleeing away, surrendered to Swamiji and sought refuge in him. Swamiji, being kind enough reached the top of the hill with king and asked him to cover his one eye with butter. Swamiji, being the worshipper of Bhuvaraha form of Lord, meditated on that form and blessed the king with Darshana of the Lord. He also earnestly prayed the Lord for King's safety. Lord Varaha assuming many forms destroyed enemy force and saved the aggrieved king and others. The seer made an appeal to Bhuvaraha Lord to save that part of the kingdom from scarcity of water. Varaha Lord moved from top to bottom of that hilly region reaching the valley of river basin. Surprisingly the water sprung up profusely and flowed down through the route of Lord's movement. The king being very much pleased and blessed, gifted the vast land of that region to Ratnagarbhatirtha. There is a small pond on the top of that region, where sufficient water is seen flowing even during summer. As a memorial to this incident, even now the reflection of the image of Varaha is seen in that pond. This spot of Narala is also well known birth place of Sri Bhutarajaru. Sri Bhutarajaru, in that region, is popularly known as �Naralattaya�.",
            "Sri Ratnagarbhatirtha lived in Narala for many years. It is said that Ratnagarbhatirtha departed from his mortal body with the help of self Yogic power when his Guru was still alive. Therefore, it could be understood that Ratnagarbhatirtha entombed prior to 1422 A.D. The holy Vrindavana and surrounding area of this place brims with nature beauty. It happens to be more agreeable and cherishable spot of rare concentration for deep Yogic practice and Shastric studies. The reference available in ORI Mysore states that there is a commentary on Mahabharata Tatparyanirnaya written in the name of Sri Ratnagarbhatirtha.

Varaha's Upanayanam was celebrated at the age of five and he was ordained the Samnyasashrama soon after the completion of 7 years by Vagishatirtha. He was named as Vadirajatirtha. The Ashramanama is significant as it conveys the rich proficiency and pre-eminence in delivering the true import of lores in skilful manner with fitness evoking surprise. It also means that Vadiraja is an undaunted debater like mighty lion to the elephants of opponents.

It was also a tour to gain wide experience and a chance to exhibit the mystic power involuntarily. He travelled the entire country several times and composed a unique work in Sanskrit viz; Tirthaprabandha that gives an account of various holy Hindu temples, places, sacred rivers and reservoirs.",

After the Vrindavanapravesha of Vadiraja, once, Vedavedya wished to have the Darshana and conversation with his master Vadiraja. For this he made an earnest appeal at Vrindavanasannidhi. Accordingly, Vadiraja gave him a hint of date and time through dream. On that stipulated day and time the front covered stone was slided by Sri Bhutaraja. Vedavedya with others, saw beautiful and delectable form of Vadiraja for one Muhurtha and felt very much delighted. During the period of Vedavedya's second biennial Paryaya, Venkatappanaik, a subordinate king of Ikkeri, gifted the Huvinakere village (1613) (the stone inscriptions seen in Krishnamatha Udupi).

He also brought inforce the proclamation of Paraku (Singing Vadiraja's titles in praise) at the end of evening worship daily. Since then, these customary observations have been put into practice with orderliness. Vedavedya is Rushi (Seer of presiding deity of Mantra) to Vadiraja Mantra.

            "Sri Vidyanidhitirtha took Samnyasashrama from Vedavedyatirtha in the year 1585 A.D. He studied under Vadiraja. Vidyanidhi was a right hand to Vedavedya and rendered assistance in his first Paryaya (1596-97). He was a good orator. Once, at the time of studying, Vidyanidhitirtha asked one irrelevant question to Vadiraja. Vadiraja was not happy with that question and hence stopped the teaching (Patha). He told Vidyanidhi about the short span of his life and suggested him to go on holy pilgrimage. Accordingly, Vidyanidhi went on short pilgrimage and returned to Kumbhasimatha. There only, he entombed in the year 1598. The period of Samnmyasa-sharama of Sri Vidyanidhi was 13 years. Hence, we do not find any reference of Vidyanidhi at the time of Vadiraja's Vrindavanapra-vesha. In this lineage, it was only the Vidyanidhitirtha who had not performed the Paryaya at Udupi. Before his Vrindavanapravesha, he, at the instruction of Vadiraja, nominated his successor in the year 1593 and named him as Sri Vedanidhitirtha. The holy Vrindavana of Vidyanidhitirtha is situated by the side of the Vrindavana of Sri Varadarajatirtha-I at Kumbhasimatha Kumbhasi. In this lineage, there were four pontiffs during 1593-1598."

            "Sri Vedanidhitirtha, gene-rally known as Prashishya of Vadiraja, took Samnyasa-shrama from Vidyanidhi-tirtha in the year 1593. He continued the unbroken practice of Japa, Tapa, study of lores, worship etc, with dedication. Being assistant, Vedanidhitirtha served Vadiraja during fifth Paryaya at Sode. Once, when Vadiraja was on tour, he expressed his intension for oil bath. The king Arasappanayaka casually questioned. But he was put confined. Swamiji got fulfilled his desire. After returning, Vadiraja came to know the fact and instructed Vedanidhitirtha to undergo the act of expiation because both the things were not agreeable to Samnyasins. Accordingly, a small pond was erected and it was filled in with cow dung and cow's urine. Vedanidhitirtha used stay there for few hours daily for 48 days. By this act, he became purified. Vedanidhitirtha was fortunate enough to have the visible sight of Vrindavana-pravesha of Vadiraja. Then after sometime, at the heart felt appeal of Vedanidhitirtha, Vadiraja showed his beautiful form abiding in Mulavrindavana to Vedanidhitirtha, Lakshmipati and others. He used to listen to the articulation of sacred text of Vrindavanakhyana from a deaf and dumb Brahmin as taught by Vadiraja in the dream. Vedanidhitirtha got it documented through his pupil Ramachandracharya. And that is the great authority work Svapnavrindavanakhyana which elucidates the essentials of Shastra, Svarupamahima of Vadiraja, matchless greatness of his Vrindavana, way of rendering devoted service at Vrindavana Sannidhi etc.,",
            "Vedanidhitirtha happened to be a chief motivator and seer-man of mission in making this wonderful work available to the mass of Vadiraja's devotees. It is not an exaggeration to state that Vedanidhi was original source and instrumental in its publicity at initial stage. Besides this, he, at the hint of Vadiraja, collected some verses from Vrindavanakhyana and composed Anuvrindavanakhyana through compilation. Vedanidhitirtha included a Shloka, spelled out by Vadiraja in his dream and unfound in the Vrindavanakhyana, which runs as AW�� o��� c� u��r�Ѷ� . . . . . |. This Shloka briefs the epitome of Vrindavanakhyana significantly. (Sri Vishwottamatirtha used to explain its significance in many ways). He also got it stone inscribed and installed by the side of Vedavedyatirtha's Vrindavana at Sode. He also introduced daily worship of that holy inscription. Once, Vedanidhi made up his mind to establish a huge sacred stone pillar (Dhvajastambha) infront of Trivikrama temple at Sode. But, at every trial it used to fall. Then, at the instruction of Vadiraja in dream and suggestive hint at Vrindavanakhyana, he got inscribed the figure of Hamsarudha of Vadiraja on the pillar. Afterwards, he was successful in the installation of that. And, these three things have obviously become the perceivable evidences in respect of proclaiming the Rujutvamahima of Sri Vadiraja. In this case, all the devotees of Vadiraja should ever be indebted to Sri Vedanidhitirtha. Vedanidhitirtha, being taught and instructed by Vadiraja, is also one of leading characters in Vrindavanakhyana. At the time of Vadiraja, the Madhyavatamatha and Vyasamushti therein were under the possession of Sri Sode Vadiraja Matha. And therefore, Sri Vedanidhitirtha used to go to Madhyavatamatha frequently. In that place, there was a king Cobra. Due to negligence, if any defilement were to be found in the Matha, that serpent used to go around the Matha and sit with its hood raised up. By this, the inmates of that location were very much afraid of that. Realising this problem and difficulty, Vedanidhitirtha, with his super human power, brought that serpent under his control and changed the situation and place. He instructed it to be present at Sode. Since then, the presence of that king serpent be seen at Sode besides the ten Vrindavanas in eastern direction. Vedanidhitirtha entombed in the year 1648 A.D. His Vrindavana is situated at Sode. It is the middle one among the ten situated back of Papavimochanatirtha. His period of Samnyasashrama was 55 years and period of pontificial incharge was 32 years. Vedanidhi did two biennial Paryayas at Udupi (1628-29, 1644-45). The tradition holds the view that Vedanidhitirtha is qualified divine being to occupy the post of god Garuda in the next age (Kalpa). And this is also evidently acclaimed in Vrindavanakhyana."

He engaged always in teaching the Shastric works like Nyayasudha, Yuktimallika etc. He has composed a great Mahakavya namely Subhadraharana. He has written Shloka formed commentary on Vishnusahasranama and also a gloss on that. This commentary is rare of its kind. He gained a very good deal of mastery over different lores, including Vedanta by the gracious blessings of Madhva and Vadiraja. He used to teach major works to some pontiffs and other scholars of that time. Might be in travel or not, he used to make Parayana of 'Sarvamula' and other works regularly. He undertook the renovation of Vadiraja Matha at Sode for the first time and completed that. The tradition records an unique incident that happened in the life of Sri Vibudhavaryatirtha. And that confirms the seer's super power of favouring and castigating.",
            "There was a brahmin by name Ramakrishna in Udyavara, four kms away from Udupi. Being jealous with Vibudha-varyaswamiji, he misinform-ed to the king of Ikkeri about the character of Swamiji. Listening to that, the king made up his mind to attack and punish Swamiji. He planned and deployed some royal servants on border point. Once Swamiji, on the way to Sode, was supposed to cross that border point. He was stopped and detained by that force. The king robbed golden ornaments, silver articles and honorific materials and deported Swamiji and his followers off the border line. Swamiji felt very bad and with followers airdashed to Sode. There he resorted to the vow of fast and began the devoted service at the feet of Vadiraja. After some days, pleased with the devoted service of Vibudhavaryatirtha, Vadiraja appeared in the dream and consoled him. As a remedy to all this, Vadiraja asked to compose a great poem 'Subhadraharana'. Accordingly, Vibudhavaryatirtha started the composing of great poem. When it was about to complete Vadiraja again appeared in the dream and instructed Swamiji not to compose the last auspicious Shloka. Vibudhavaryatirtha stayed at Sode for some more time and used to worship the icons of Parampara on banana leaf with flowers and Tulasi. This continued for some period. And again Vadiraja appeared in the dream and asked Swamiji to compose the last Shloka and complete the work. Following day, when Vibudhavaryatirtha was composing the last auspicious Shloka, a rich man, at the dream-hint of Vadiraja, came there and in the presence of Swamiji, consecrated sixteen thousand silver coins at the holy spot of Vrindavana. Vibudhavaryatirtha got all the ornaments done with that amount. Meanwhile, as a result of sinful act of Gurudroha, King Nagara Ikkeri lost his wife and children. And he was repenting for that sinful act. He was also waiting for the arrival of Swamiji. After some days, Swamiji set out for Udupi. When Swamiji reached the boundary line of his kingdom, king fell at the feet of Swamiji and earnestly appealed to redeem him from the evil effects of that sinful act. He clarified that he was misinformed and prompted to commit the blunder.",
            "He said that he had then realised the truth. He begged repeatedly to bless him by doing the worship at his palace and receiving the honour. Swamiji rejected his request outright and said �You are rogue and fate rejected. You have shown disrespect and done injustice. You have pained me by your arrogant behaviour. Hence, I don't come to your abode� Saying thus Swamiji marched ahead. Then with repentance, king fell at the feet of Swamiji and wept a lot. Swamiji was kind enough and accepted his request. He went to king's abode, performed the worship and received the hospitality. The king detailed that he was misinformed and misguided by Ramakrishnayya of Udyavara and hence all that offence occurred. He also told that he had lost his wife, children and other things. He realised that it was because of Gurudroha he was suffering severely. He was totally afraid of evil results in this life and the life hereafter. He begged Swamiji to forgive. He immediately brought back the box containing golden ornaments and other silver articles. When the box was opened, there was surprise to see that except face-amulet and sapphire (blue) gem of the weapon of Hayagriva icon, everything was turned into ash. The king offered ornaments and also all golden coins he had. Swamiji, being compassionate warded the king's defect off. The king wanted to punish Ramakrishnayya but, Swamiji stopped him to do so. Swamiji told that punishing a Brahmin would indeed cause Brahmadroha and hence that was not acceptable. He also said that Ramakrishnayya, owing to his mischief deed, would suffer a lot. As Swamiji foretold, Ramakrishnayya, with poverty and more number of torturing children, was totally unhappy and distressed and ended his life with severe suffering.",
            "Sri Vibudhavaryatirtha taught Srimanyayasudha for eleven times and did the Mangala on grand scale at Udupi and Sode. Swamiji, at his old age, tended to write commentary on Nyayasudha namely �Vimalabodhini�. He started writing but in his dream, he was instructed by Vadiraja to stop that. Vadiraja also convinced him that he had already fulfilled the objectives or goals of life, there was no need to write any commentary as such. Vadiraja advised him to resort to medtiation. Vibudhavaryatirtha gave up the writing and left for Udupi. He also resorted to the meditation for remaining period and entered the holy Vrindavana in the year 1739 A.D. He performed Krishnaparyaya during 1724-25. Swamiji's Aradhana falls on Margashira month-Bahula Shashti. His Vrindavana is situated at the back of Vrindavanacharya's Vrindavana in Udupi. The period of his pontificial incharge of Vedanta empire was 17 years."

But, that glory was not for personal comfort. It was in the form of daily worship, Paryaya worship, teaching and discourse of Shastric works.

Swamiji, through his intuitive knowledge, was well knowing about golden Mantapa. After enquiry of well being etc., Swamiji asked Poornayya to gift the golden Mantapa so that it could be used at Krishnamatha Udupi for adorned worship. Poornayya did not respond suddenly and positively for he had the desire to gift it to somebody else. He went inside and held discussion with his wife. Both of them realised the fact that all forms of supreme Lord are non-different and identical in nature. They decided to offer that golden Mantapa to Vishwadhishwaratirtha. With regard and reverence, honouring Swamiji, they consecrated that golden Mantapa to Krishna formed Lord. Swamiji received it and handed over to Krishnamatha.

When he was ordained into Samnyasashrama, his guru came to know that his disciple was not so intelligent and wise as expected. Because, Vishweshatirtha was not reacting and responding skilfully after teaching. Guru was unhappy and became indifferent towards his Shishya Vishweshatirtha. Shishya felt very bad and made-up his mind to find an agreeable solution. He left Matha and roamed about for some days. He came to a secluded and remote place. He began severe penance to propitiate the Lord and deities. Goddess Saraswati, presiding deity of knowledge was very much pleased with penance and physically appeared before Vishweshatirtha. She wrote Bijakshara (an energised syllable) on his tongue and by doing so she granted vast and skilled knowledge. By the gracious favour of Goddess Saraswati, Vishweshatirtha became a great knowledged person. He went to north India and visited many leading learning centres. He participated in scholarly debates and discourses. In debates, he defeated many scholars and adorned Kashi Vidyapeetha. Everywhere, Swamiji was honoured with Jayapatra. On his way to Udupi, he came to Sode and engaged in the devoted Seva at the feet of Sri Vadirajaru. By the warm favour of Vadiraja, Vishweshatirtha used to shine with brilliance of intellectual excellence. He became famous and popular like the musk present in the navel of deer. Seeing blessed Shishya dazzling with academic excellence, Guru Sri Vishwadhishwaratirtha was very much delighted and happy. Swamiji went on south India tour. The king of Cochin (Ramavarma) was influenced by the unique mystic power of Swamiji. He got initiated into Madhva diksha. He became an ardent devotee of Swamiji. Swamiji stayed there for some months and taught Madhvashastra to him. By the order of Guru, Vishweshatirtha nominated the successor to the succession and named him Vishwapriyatirtha. It is learnt from the history that at the time of Vishweshatirtha, munificent gifts were consecrated to Krishnamatha Udupi and Sode Vadiraja Matha from Keladi king and others. Tradition opines that Vishweshatirtha entered the holy Vrindavana even when his Guru was alive. This seems to be agreeable to the information seen in the Vrindavanakhyana. But in this respect, authentic and historical documented records are not available. Swamiji's Vrindavana is situated at Kenchagaru village near Honnavara. He is popularly known as Kenchagaru Swamiji. The year of Vrindavanapravesha was 1794. Annual Aradhana falls on Magha month Krishna Trayodashi. In Vrindavanakhyana, he is known as 'Vipraguru'. Since his proper name was Vitthala by birth, he was addressed as Vitthala in Vrindavanakhyana. The sub-divided portion, related to him, is titled as Vitthalaprakarana. He is repeatedly asked to be away from unrighteous circle and also instructed to handover the responsibility of Pacchotika (the holy case of deities) to his successor Vishwapriyatirtha.",

            "Sri Vishwapriyatirtha was a Shakapurusha and great mystic divine being of nineteenth century. He was born in the year 1774 in Inna village near Udupi. He was the son of Krishnacharya (Nagashayana) eldest brother of Vitthalacharya (Vipraguru-Vishweshatirtha). His name was Srinivasa. After undergoing the rites of refinement such as Jatakarma, Nama-karana, Chowla, Upa-nayana etc., he was ordained into Samnya-sashrama at the running age of ten by Guru Vishwesha-tirtha and named as Vishwa-priyatirtha. He did his basic Shastradhyayana under his aged Paramaguru Sri Vish-wadhishwaratirtha. When he made up his mind to go elsewhere for higher studies then, in dream Vadiraja hinted at him to come to his abode (Sode). Sri Vishwapriyatirtha went to Sode and engaged in devoted service (Seva) at the holy Panchavrindavanasannidhi of SriVadiraja. He also did rigorous penance by taking only a fistful fried rice mixed with curds at the end of evening worship daily. Sitting front of Vrindavanasannidhi, he continued the study of Sarvamula and other works and got the doubts cleared through the divine speech of Vadiraja emanating from Vrindavana. By virtue of this, he was well known as Vrindavanacharya. He also submitted himself at the holy presence of SriVedavedya and got blessed by that saint seer. When Vrindavanacharya decided to go on holy pilgrimage, he prostrated before Vadiraja's Vrindavana to obtain permission from Vadiraja. Surprisingly, there fell the Mantrakshata on his head from Vrindavana.",
            "The Vrindavanacharya was like a deaf and dumb Brahmin at the time of Vadiraja. After Vadiraja's Vrindavana pravesha he, in his dream listened to the glorious teaching of holy text Vrindavanakhyana. Now, he got incarnated to popularise that sacred text. By way of getting written the holy text Akhyana, Vedanidhitirtha is well known as the master beginner (Srikara), whereas Vrindavanacharya is popularly known to be its Harikara (authority in teaching and spreading its greatness). He got written a befitting and wise commentary by his pupil Srimushnacharya. And by another competent and capable Shishya SriRaghupraveeratirtha of Bhimanakatte Matha, he got authored a validity substantiating work namely 'Vrindavanakhyana Pramanyaprabodhini'. SriVrindav-anacharya happened to be a prime person character in Vrindavanakhyana. He is the chief listener and is addressed as 'Vipra'. To prove the identity of Vrindavanacharya with that Vipra (likely a deaf and dumb Brahmin) we get note of some historical illustrations in the biographical works of Vrindavanacharya which have reference hinted at Akhyana by Vadiraja. E.g. the vow of Nirannatva, bringing Vyasamushti from Madhyavata Matha and worshipping it at Krishnasannidhi, making Prakarana in Vrindavanakhyana and popularising it and others.",
            "Vrindavanacharya used to write holy texts daily and give the written material to his pupils. Tradition records that Vrindavanacharya was none to second in the world of scholars. Not only the localities of Udupi, but, hundreds of scholars belonging to other parts of the country became his pupils and studied well. Swamiji was specially honoured by the kings of Mysore and Cochin royal families. The king of Mysore namely Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, seeing the extra ordinary Mahima of Sri Vrindavanacharya, consecrated an invaluable small Mantapa of emerald to great saint. During his Paryaya period, special gifts and ornaments were consecrated to Krishnasannidhi. Vrindavanacharya performed 4 biennial Paryayas at Udupi with great adoration and glory. (1804-1805, 1820-21, 1836-37 and 1852-53). During 1784 to 1794, there were three pontiffs in the line of Sri Sode Vadirajamatha. SriVrindavanacharya was not merely a scholar but also a highly knowledgeable in case of subtle topics of Vedanta (Prameyajna). The Vairagya (detached attachment) of Swamiji was superior and incomparable. Even in Paryaya Darbar, he had only Kaupin on his body. Knowing the peak mounted Vairagya of Vishwapriyatirtha, Sri Bhuvanendratirtha of Raghavendra-swamy Matha exclaimed that it was totally agreeable in case of Vishwapriyatirtha for he was the descendant of the lineage of Sri Vishnutirtha a true embodiment of Vairagya.",
            "Once through his mystic power Swamiji saved a devotee drowned into the water of Kaveri river. His blessed Mantrakshata caused delayed and painful delivery easy. Swamiji's command for continuation of Seva favoured to have the progeny of an excellent devotee of Sri Vadirajaru (Jambukhandi Vadirajacharyaru). Once, thieves utterly failed to identify Swamiji for he got disappeared from their sight. The holy remembrance of name of Sri Vrindavanacharya blessed more physical strength to a devotee by name Ramachar to do the Seva entrusted to him without any difficulty. Swamiji's blessings granted the power of speech to chant the Vedic Mantras clearly and eloquently in the performance of Samhita Yaga at Udupi. The great scholar of Kanchi, Sri Tathacharya got stunned at the matchless erudition and scholarship of Swamiji and surrendered himself. Once at Sode, a magician ran away due to burning pain caused by the invocation of Swamiji at the holy Sannidhana of Sri Bhutarajaru. At the time of journey, the deception and fraud was rocked and ruined by Swamiji. Sri Vrindavanacharya was fortunate to have the holy Darshana of Ganga in Dhavalatirtha at Sode. The scared saying of Swamiji caused an enormous increase in the quantity of food for easy and sufficient serving on the beginning day of Paryaya. The rare device and practical solution planned and executed by Swamiji blessed the king of Cochin to have the sample experience of liberation and cleared the related doubts away. The instructive teachings of Vrindavanacharya initiated a devotee into the recitation of Sri Krishna Stuti composed by Sri Vadirajaru and as a result he was graciously granted holy Darshana of Sri Krishna. The holy and soft touch of palm of Sri Swamiji reenergised a devotee and blessed consciousness when the latter, after getting drowned into water, fell unconscious. The validity of Samatva worship of Vadiraja with god Vayu, got reconfirmed by Swamiji. At Rameshwara, for scared sipping (Achamana) the ocean water became sweet by the greatness of Swamiji. The expiatory rite with repentance, as instructed by Swamiji, removed the cursed state of senselessness.",
            "Vrindavanacharya lived for 91 years and entered the holy Vrindavana in the year 1865 A.D. at Udupi. The annual Aradhana is observed on Ashadha month Krishna Amavasya. He enjoyed the in charge of pontificial seat of Vedanta empire for 62 years. Regarding life history of Sri Vrindavanacharya, three bio-graphical works are written by direct pupil-students who were witness of many incidents occurred in the life of Guru.",
            "The holy Vrindavana of SriVrindavanacharya is located by the side of Sri Vagishatirtha's Vrindavana at Udupi. The figure of a Brahmin carved on the Vrindavana signifies that Vrindavanacharya was that brahmin and pupil student at the time of Vadiraja who listened to the Vrindavanakhyana in his dream. The order of the icons of Hayagriva-Vedavyasa and Bhuvaraha carved on the top also signifies the performance and introduction of Samanadhikaranya kind of worship by Vrindavanacharya. The information, available in bio-graphical works, Vrindavanakhyana, Stotras-Padas and tradition, ascertain the fact that Vrindavanacharya is the qualified divine soul to occupy the post of god Indra in the next Kalpa."

            "Sri Vishwadhishatirtha was a direct disciple of Vrindavan-acharya. Graced with tall and stout personality, Swamiji was generally known and addressed as 'Hiriya Swamigalu' (senior Swamiji). He had the good deal of impression of past life. By virtue of that he was blessed with abundant knowledge. He studied under great and matchless scholar Sri Vidyadhishatirtha of Krishnapur matha. In addition to this, to please and propitiate his Guru Vrindavanacharya he did regular recitation of Samgraha Ramayana of Narayana pundit for a period of one Mandala at the holy presence of Mukhyaprana in Udupi. By the gracious favour of Mukhyaprana, Swamiji gained enormous knowledge and became undaunted scholar-debater par excellence. He enjoyed good deal of mastery over more number of leading Shastric works. He used to teach the Swamijis of other Mathas. Sri Vibudhapriya-tirtha of Adamaru matha, SriVidyasamudratirtha of Kaniyuru matha, Sri Vidya-purnatirtha of Krishnapur matha and others were his pupil students. All of them became great scholars. Sri Vishwadhishatirtha was end-owed with unique debating skill. Although young, he had the vast knowledge of different lores. His explicit personality used to hint at intellectual breadth and depth of academic superiority. In his presence, opponents could not continue the debating. They used to say 'good by' at an earliest. He was a terror to opponents and prime source of inspiration and guidance to scholarly world. When a sect of Madhvas convened a meeting at Madras in the year 1884 and opposed the Rujutva of Vadiraja, then Vishwa-dhishatirtha suddenly reacted and responded to that by organising mass meeting at Udupi. He collected then available evidences in support of Rujutva of Vadiraja and published an authentic work nam-ely 'Rujutvachandro-daya'. It gave impulse to contribute other volumes substantiating the Ruju-tva of Vadiraja. Swamiji performed two biennial Paryayas (1868-69, 1884-85). He renovated some portion of inner shrine of Sri Krishnamatha. There was due regard and recognition to the unique scholarship of Swamiji every-where especially by queen Victoria. A letter of recognition and praise is still seen at Sode Vadiraja Matha, Udupi as an authentic document. It is learnt that on the day of Vrindavanapravesha of Swamiji, holiday was declared. Swamiji entombed at Udupi in the year 1889 A.D. His Vrindavana is found in the middle back of the Vrindavana of Vrindavanacharya. Annual Aradhana falls on Ashadha month Krishna Amavasya. His period of pontificial incharge of Vedanta empire was 34 years."

            "Sri Vishwendratirtha was born in 1881. At the time of Samnyasashrama, he was 16 years old. He continued his Shastric studies under Sri Vibudhapriyatirtha of Adamar Matha. He was highly qualified in Veda-Vedanta fields. As Swamiji was a great scholar in Shastric field he was equally talented in the field of literature. He has composed many poems in Kannada. The style is embellished with literary touch. The narra-tion in composition brims with clarity. The pen name of Swamiji is 'Rajesh-Rajanath'. Sri Vish-wendratirtha has also composed a small Sanskrit work namely Sri Vadirajashtaka. It is in the form of praise and prayer glorifying the main incidents of Vadiraja's life. The performance of daily worship by Swamiji was distinct and decent. It was elaborate and glorious. With one or other reason, he never shortened it. At the time of worship, chanting of Mantra-recitation and singing of songs were mandatory. The life of Samnyasashrama of Swamiji was ideal in all respects. Swamiji performed three biennial Paryayas successfully. (1900-01, 1916-17, 1932-33) He renovated the construction of Vrindavanashala at Udupi. As per the records available, the renovation was completed on 02-01-1934. He too had the concern with mundane affairs of issues for tackling them. And it was because of that concern he readily came forward to give importance to modern education also. He established a high school namely 'Vishnumurthy Hayavadanaswamy High School' in Innanje. He was the first person in that field to step ahead for spreading modern education in that region. Now, it is upgraded to P.U.College. It is developed in all respects and it has become one of the best and leading educational institutions in that area.",
            "Sri Vishwendratirtha travelled this land and visited many holy centres. Getting enga-ged in Patha-Pravac-hana, he was highly adorable to scholars. Swamiji was supporting and nourishing the scholars. He was very fond of feeding others. He was also kind enough towards poor and needy. Being endowed with mystic powers, he used to bless the honest devotees with Mantrakshatas for progeny etc. As he was well versed in the Yuktimallika of Vadiraja, he organised Maha Sabha (scholarly meet-ing) namely 'Yuktimallika Sourabha Prakashini' for many years. He also organised special lectures by inviting the scholars from different places. The venue was the corridor of Sri Ananteshwara temple. He took up initial renovation work in some branch Mathas. In 1928, at the invitation of king Ramavarma of Cochin he went to southern India and visited Cochin. He was specially honoured by the king. The king was very much influenced and gifted some golden ornaments and also Rs.3,000/- (Rupees Three Thousand) cash in the form of devoted Seva to the coming Paryaya (1932-33) in advance. Knowing this, the incharge of Anatashayanam also invited the seer and honoured him. In the year 1939 he toured in the Mysore region. Owing to the invitation of king Krishna-rajendra Wodeyar, Swamiji visited royal palace and received due honour. He shared the platform along with Swamijis of Uttaradimatha, Kundapuramatha and Puttigematha. Since the king wished to have the observance of Chaturmasya of Swamiji in Nanjangudu, the seer observed his Chaturmasya of that year in Nanjangudu. There he established 'Sri Krishnamadhva Sabha' parallel to 'Srikanteshwara Advaita Mahasabha' and collecting the huge fund he gifted to the same Sabha. He had high regard and reverence in respect of rich tradition of Madhvacharya and SriVadiraja and also in its practice. In his oldage, Swamiji used to stay at Udyavara Matha. Being a great Ayurvedic physician, he prepared a medicated oil known as 'Hayagrivataila'.",
            "Since then, it has been prepared by the Swamijis of Sode Vadirajamatha till today. It is very popular and widely used to get away from rheumatic and other body pains. Swamiji was also treating the patients suffering from severe diseases successfully. Once he gave the treatment to the seer Sri Sudhindratirtha of Puttige Matha. In the year 1941, Sri Vishwendrairtha got celebrated diamond jubilee of his Peetharohanam on a grand scale. He entered the holy Vrindavana in the year 1943 A.D. at Udyavara. His Aradhana falls on Ashwina month Shukla Navami. The period of his pontificial incharge of Vedanta empire was 44 years."

            "Sri Vishwottamatirtha, who flourished in the 20th century was a saint pontiff of crown personality. He was stock sample of rare combination of discipline of Samnyasashrama and deep Shastric knowledge. He was always peaceful and calm. He used to deal with things with serene approach and sensible attempt. He used to prefer to have secluded place for deep deliberation of learning. Sri Vishwottamatirtha was born of pious couple Sri Krishnacharya and Smt Krishnaveni in Udyavara near Udupi in the year 1934 A.D. (Srimukha Samvatsara Pushya month Krishna Trayodashi). He underwent essential rites of refinement (Samskara) such as Jatakarma, Namakarana, Upanayana etc., as prescribed on time. His name was Madhava. Madhava didn't have much interest in sport and amusement. Since his childhood, he was liking lonely place. At this age, Madhava preferred to resort to mediation several times. Seeing that brilliant lad, Sri Vishwendratirtha wished to have that boy as his successor. But, parents did not like to sacrifice that lovely child. Lord Hayagriva gave a hint in the dream of mother. Then, parents handed over their son Madhava to Guru Vishwendratirtha wholeheartedly. Vishwendratirtha ordained Samnyasa-shrama to Madhava and named him Sri Vishwottamatirtha. It was in the year 1943 A.D. (Svabhanusamvatsara Bhadrapada month Shukla Chaturthi). After one month and five days, Vishwendratirtha entombed on Svabhanu Samvatsara Ashvina month Sukla Navami (1943). Then, Sri Vishwottamatirtha bore the responsibility of Matha. His basic learning started with the help of some local pundits. His personality was distinct one. He was an embodiment of honesty and nobleness. His majesty stood concealed like fire covered with ash. Swamiji continued his higher studies of Vedanta and other lores at the gracious presence of Sri Vidyasamudratirtha of Kaniyoor matha who was a scholar of repute and a great sage of self discipline. The unique power of intelligence, the act of comprehending, the strength of merit etc, of Vishwottamatirtha immensely pleased Guru Vidyasamudratirtha Swamiji. He gained the abundant wealth of knowledge and engaged in the prescribed practice of Japa, Tapa etc. He remained far away from publicity, prestige, praise etc. In respect of traditional prescription and practice, the decent, the humble and modest approach of Swamiji was beyond expression. His initiation, adherence, faithfulness and inclination towards Madhvasiddhanta and Rujutva of Vadiraja was distinct, firm and unfathomable. He had the responsible regard and unhampered alertness in case of Vadiraja and Bhutaraja Mahima. SriVishwotta-matirtha was a source of solution to the grievances of grieved. The Mantrakshata, blessed with favouring prayer by him, redressed the botherations of thousa-nds of faithful devotees. That Mantrakshata has, even now, become the prime safe guardian to many. His Hitopadesha has be-come serene light for hopeful and painless march in the life. His Mantropadesha has ene-rgised the virtuous power to worship, propitiate the divinities and Gurus to receive choicest bless-ings for spiritual achieve-ment and solace. He was a ray of hope to helpless. He was a light of enli-ghtenment to the learners. He was a rich treasure of scholarship to scholars. He was a devout delegate to deliver desired devices to faithful devotees. His lovely glance seemed to be worthy of seeing for he used to meet and treat even the unknown as known. The very seeing of Swamiji used to suggest the fact of presence of divinity. His prayer rescued hundred of devotees from untimely end and disasters. The beneficial expressions of Swamiji could, although scanty, always sustain the sweet remembrance of Vadiraja and Bhutaraja. Without that sweet reference, he said nothing. He preferred to have lonely place always. It was because of studying the holy texts repeatedly to understand and comprehend them better. He used to have one or other sacred book always in his hand. Out of classical academic interest, he had the credit of collecting the rare and old manuscripts related to different branches of knowledge. The number of manuscripts collected crosses two thousand. It was his individual and personal endeavour. Swamiji upgraded the Secondary Institution at Innanje to Pre- University College and introduced some courses relevant to modern science and technology.",
            "Swamiji's daily observance related to Japa, Tapa, worship etc., was highly disciplined and time oriented. Neither there was compromise nor even concise in that. Vishwottamatirtha had having high regard and reverence incase of all saint superiors. He paid visit to Navavrindavana, Mantralaya, Uttanuru, Sankapur, Venisomapur, Chippagiri, Manavi, Chikalaparavi, Kenchanagudda, Hampi, Savanur, Thirukoyiluru, Kumbhakona, Rajamahendri, Sangali, Ritti, Holehonnuru, Madanur, Bhimanakatte and other holy centres and offered salutations to presiding deity and Guru. Swamiji started a big Goshala at Huvinakere for aged cows and thus tried his best to avoid cow-slaughter. Hundreds of cows are given shelter, food etc. and thus protected. He went on an extensive tour visiting all places from Kanyakumari to Vasudhara. He became virtuous by seeing Sri Ranga and other holy centres and also by taking holy dip in Ganga and other rivers.",
            "Sri Vishwottamatirtha had many works and important statements by heart. His analysis, inquiry etc, was discretionary and judgement oriented. The style of teaching was uninterrupted and it was prime source of reflection and retention. Being leading scholar in Shastric field, he taught Shastric works like Nyayasudha and others to Sri Vidya-sagaratirtha Swamiji of Krishnapur matha and others. The teaching was superb and unique. Swamiji has brought to light many unpublished works of Vadiraja and others. The words anger, wrath etc., are unfound in his knowledge of words (Kosha). Therefore, he could manage the administration and transactions easily and successfully. Sri Vishwottamatirtha undertook the needful renovation and new construction work at many branches of his Matha namely, Kumbasi, Tirthahalli, Narala, Bilagi, Udyavara, Undaru, Huvinakere, Madhya-vata, Sode, Renjala, Udupi, Kenchagaru. In Sode, the reno-vation and construction of Poojamandira, Vrinda-vanasannidhi, retiring rooms, dining hall, kitchen, Gurukula etc., was historical one. To him, Soda Kshetra was all in all. He used to stay there during Chaturmasya and other occasions. He got engaged in special observance of Japa, Tapa etc, and got blessed graciously by Vadiraja and Bhutaraja. Sri Vishwottamatirtha performed four Paryayas (1948-49, 1964-65, 1980-81, 1996-97) on grand scale with great grace. During third Paryaya, Swamiji organised 500th year of Vadiraja Jayanthi on a large scale successfully. During fourth Paryaya (1996-97) he got constructed Vadiraja Mandira besides Badagumalige at Krishnamatha and consecrated to Lord Krishna. At the hint instruction of Vrindavanakhyana and dream indication, Swamiji got done the stone inscription of entire sacred text Vrindavanakhyana. He got built Akhyanamanidra in front of Panchavrindavana Sanidhi at Sode and consecrated it at the feet of Sri Lakshmi Hayavadana, an adorable deity of Madhva and Vadiraja. Vishwottamatirtha established Bhavisameera Gurukula at Sode in the year 2006 and thus gave impetus and importance to Shastric studies. On 18-08-2007, the revered Swamiji completed daily worship, participated in Haridasa function and gave blessing speech. After day meals, he favoured the mass of devotees with Mantrakshata and at about 2:00 pm uttering the Lord's holy name 'Rama, Rama, Rama' three times departed from the mortal body without any unnatural changes and abnormity. His period of incharge of pontificial Vedanta empire was 64 years. Let the sweet remembrance of holy name 'Vishwottamatirtha' remove all the obstacles for easy observance of divine worship and adoration and become the chief means for securing blessed favour of Sri Hari-Vayu-Vadirajaru, Bhutarajaru and others."

            "Sri Vishwavallabhatirtha was born of honest and virtuous couple Srinivasa Tantri and Smt. Vedavati in Padigaru near Udupi on 24-03-1991. Undergoing the prescribed rites of refinement such as Jatakarma, Namakarana and others, he got the name 'Raghava'. As he was born on Ramajayanthi, the name 'Raghava' was agreeable in all respects. Even in childhood, Raghava preferred to have Ekanta. He grew as lovely child of mother. Raghava used to assist his mother in homely affairs. Raghava's grandfather was Vidwan Sri Gururaj Tantri. He was a great scholar, knower of rich tradition and an authority in Dharmashastra (code of laws). As he was strictly adhered to the observance of Ekadashi, he was well known as Ekadashi Tantri. As he was endowed with the power of Mantra, he, at the birth of Raghava, predicted and pre told that born child would become glorious and achieve something extra-ordinary. The style of Raghava's life was a sample of discipline. In his responsible life, timely awareness and proper endeavour are reciprocally intact and promising in achieving the goal.",
            "Even at the primary and secondary learning, religious understanding and observance were harmless and unsublated. When the topic of Samnyasashrama was proposed, the parents did not agree to handover their lovely son. When there was a formal and casual recollection of past hopeful wish and the realisation of Lord's resolve, parents rushed to Sode and informed with respect to Sri Vishwottamatirtha about their consent. It was the good fortune of Raghava to become the successor of the seat of Vedanta empire graciously adorned by Madhvacharya, Vishnutirtha, Vadiraja and other great saint pontiffs. Raghava took the Samnyasashrama in the year 14-06-2006 from Sri Vishwottamatirtha at Sode and became Sri Vishwa-vallabhatirtha. He learned the discipline of essentials of Samnyasashrama and put into practice. He started his studies under Sri Vidyasagaratirtha of Krishnapur Matha, an ardent student disciple of Vishwotta-matirtha. The grasping power of Vishwavallabhatirtha is unique. His behaviour is moral featured and expression work concentrated. At present, study is continued with the help of pundits.",
            "After the departure of Guru Sri Vishwottamatirtha, he took the responsibility of administration. He became great thinker and observer. Taking into consideration the necessity, he planned to take up the renovation and construction work. And accordingly, Swamiji took up the renovation and construction at Udupi, Sode and other places and completed on time. The construc-tion of Rajadhama in Sode is historical one. Swamiji started well established Goshala and Yaga-shala in Sode. Vishwavallabhatirtha has established an institution namely 'Srimadvrinda-vanacharya Samshodhana hagu Prakashana Kendra' to preserve thousands of manuscripts and other works collected by Guru Sri Vishwottamatirtha and publish. And to accord due support to scholars he has also launched a scheme namely 'Sri Vishwottamatirtha Masika Vidwatsambhavane'. The Bhavisameera Gurukula, started by Guru Sri Vishwo-ttamatirtha, is enjoying good and needy support from Swamiji and is running well. Realising well the timely need and social obligation, Vishwavallabhatirtha readily came forward with prudent vision to cater to the needs of higher education in the rural area. As a result, Swamiji has started 'Sri Madhva Vadiraja institute of Technology and Management' to encourage and support the modern system of education. This institute has better infrastructural facilities and updated learning resources. Library, labs, hostels, departments, office etc., are all well equipped. He put his efforts and started English medium section in existing school at Innanje as a boon to rural student community. He started tri monthly religious and cultural magazine 'Tattvamallika' with a view to propagate the Tattva and pass on the trusted and right information to the faithful public. To recognise the dignified academic status and contribution of learned scholars and philanthropists in the society, Swamiji has been honouring the qualified and others every year.",
            "Under the close-supervision of Swamiji, all festivals in Matha (Sode) are celebrated on grand scale with due care. Like his Guru, Swamiji has visited the centres of super-saint seers and also other holy centres. He performs daily Japa, Tapa in distinct manner. For well being of devotees, Swamiji submits an earnest appeal at the feet of Sri Hari-Vayu-Guru. Gurubhakti, firm belief and faith in Vadiraja's Rujutva is unquestionable and unequalled. He never gets yielded to any kind of pressure and obligation. The fulfilment of his blessing word (Vaksiddhi) is granting coveted results or fruits to thousands of devotees.",
            "The first biennial Paryaya of Sri Vishwavallabhatirtha has become 'Na bhooto Na Bhavishyati'. Daily worship with new and gracious Alankara, Annadana, Pravachana, Patha-Parayana, Rathotsava and other religious functions and festivals enriched the dignity and decorum of the Paryaya. And many cultural programmes, getting rare occasions and stage to exhibit the hidden talent of artists of different regions, added more brightness to the whole Paryaya. In addition to this, Aradhana functions of great saint- sages and Haridasas were celebrated in befitting manner. A national seminar on 'Vadiraja's Contribution to the Indian Philosophy, Language and Literature' was well organised to introduce the unique greatness of Vadiraja in respect of academic excellence. A series of lectures on Vrindavanakhyana was organised during the Aradhana period of Vrindavanacharya. The magnum opus-Yuktimallika of Vadiraja was published in ten volumes with complete text, commentary and translation. The entire Bhagavata, with Kannada translation in accordance with the commentary of Vijayadhwajatirtha was published in two volumes. A critical edition of Prakashasamhita has been brought to light. Recently, the Mahabharatha Tatparya Nirnaya of Sri Madhvacharya, with Vadiraja's commentary Bhavaprakashika and Kannada translation with critical notes, has been published in two volumes. During Paryaya period, cultural teams from different parts of country flocked to Udupi and exhibited their talent in various arts. Swamiji showed social concern by extending financial help to poor people irrespective of caste and creed. He continued the scheme of 'Children feeding' and also distributed uniforms to school children. Swamiji invited hundreds of scholars and organised daily discourse (lecturing) continuously for two years. By getting constructed Brahmaratha newly, he created history. Consecrating hundreds of Saptotsava, Swamiji secured grace and dearness of Lord Krishna. Thus, first biennial Paryaya of Sri Vishwavallabhatirtha was really a glorious sample and an unprecedented one. Swamiji is ever ready to rightly propagate the Dharma and Tatva. We, the faithful devotees earnestly pray Lord Hari-Vayu-Vadiraja-Bhutaraja and others to shower the choicest blessings on Sri Vishwavallabhatirtharu and fulfil his plans as dreamt at the earliest."
